# TheLifeGame
Life game on Thor. Project for programming technologies 

What do I want to do? 
Build an application using LWJGL3 (https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/releases).
It will present ordinary game Of life (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0_%C2%AB%D0%96%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%8C%C2%BB)

A user will be ale to:
1) choose filed size
2) manage game process (stop, restart, start, etc.)

I guess I will add something later.

For now I see those steps of implementation:
1) define classes
2) define interfaces 
3) make a game on 2D rectangle
4) redraw it on thor using library
